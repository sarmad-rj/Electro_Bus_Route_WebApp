# Eisenhower Matrix for Week 3 Assignment Completion

This matrix is designed to prioritize the remaining tasks for the Week 3 assignment, focusing on quick completion for a "dummy project" as per instructions.

## Urgent + Important (Do First)
*   **Populate `Eisenhower-Matrix.md` (Current Task):** Finalize planning document.
*   **Review `application_output.log` for `test-results`:** Verify output captured from `BusService` demonstration.
*   **Create placeholder content for `linkedin-proof` (User Action Required):** Prepare a basic screenshot or text indicating LinkedIn activity.
*   **Create placeholder content for `fun-week3-class` (User Action Required):** Prepare a basic photo for the in-class activity.

## Important + Not Urgent (Schedule Later)
*   **(Hypothetical) Refine `BusService`:** If time permits after core deliverables, improve error handling, add more features, or integrate with Spring's web layer. (Lower priority given "dummy project" context).
*   **(Hypothetical) Write comprehensive unit tests:** Beyond the simple main method demonstration. (Lower priority).

## Urgent + Not Important (Delegate / Automate)
*   N/A (No delegation or automation applicable for these specific tasks in this context).

## Not Urgent + Not Important (Eliminate)
*   **Extensive research into advanced data structures/algorithms:** Not required for this basic assignment completion.
*   **Deep integration with existing Spring features (beyond basic `@Service`):** Focus is on data structures, not full Spring integration for this assignment.
