🏴‍☠️ **“Electro Route Pirates: Voyage for the One Route”**



In the vast sea of Punjab Blue Line, Captain **Sarmad the Graph King** set sail to connect every island through a legendary network of glowing routes.

Beside him stood **Nazim the HashMap Navigator**, who could instantly recall the name, treasure, and coordinates of any island in the world.

Their swordsman, **Ikram the Dijkstra Slayer**, sliced through roaring sea currents to reveal the shortest path between stations.

In the kitchen of strategy, **Mazhar the Priority Cook** sorted every route request by importance, keeping the crew running smoother than a Going Merry breakfast.

Together they formed the **Electro Route Pirates**, hunting for the mythical “One Route” — a perfect sea-path that connects all islands of Punjab without delay.

Whenever a ship (bus) sailed across the map, the crew tracked it in real-time through enchanted sea-glass mirrors.

Storms of traffic slowed the world, but their AI Log Pose predicted future waves with uncanny accuracy.

From Login Island to Prediction Volcano, they traveled through maps, currents, and data storms to build the greatest navigation system the seas had ever seen.

And thus began a journey where Data Structures became crewmates, algorithms became powers, and every route led a step closer to becoming the King of Navigation.
